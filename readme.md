Display Suite
=============

Display utilities for Laravel V.

There are two parts to this package (click each one for more details):

- [Assets](docs/assets/readme.md)
- [Components](docs/components/readme.md)

### Development

Super basic roadmap:

- [x] scripts
- [x] styles
- [x] components
- [ ] validation on components (required values, etc.)
- [ ] facades for views
- [ ] recursive component wrapping
- [ ] svg ( put into symbols - https://github.com/jkphl/svg-sprite / https://github.com/w0rm/gulp-svgstore, inject into head, or link to import )
- [ ] images ( imagemin, sprites? )
- [ ] fonts ( is there something useful we can do with fonts? )
